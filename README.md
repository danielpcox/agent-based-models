# Agent Based Models

Experimenting with [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## 'Installation'

I had trouble installing Mesa from pip for some reason, so you may want to do what I did and install [the repository](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) directly.

After that, make your virtualenv, install my requirements.txt, (which is just what I got when I installed _everything_ Mesa wanted), activate it, and optionally install the iPython kernel with `python -m ipykernel install --user`.

## Usage

You can run a model from its directory with `mesa runserver`, or from the relevant notebook in `nbs/`.
